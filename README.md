## Hi, I'm Stephie 👩‍💻

I'm passionate about coding! I learnt it in high school, when I was 16 years old and ever since I've been eager to develop my skills.
With +4 years experience in consulting and delivery roles I gained a lot of experiences across industries (public services, banking, automotive, music & law).

In my [portfolio project](https://stephaniehhnbrg.github.io/StephanieHhnbrg/), you can learn more about me ✨ Enjoy!
